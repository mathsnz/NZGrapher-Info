You divide the scatter plot into 4 sections by plotting the mean point and placing a vertical and horizontal line through it.</p><p>The QCR = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Number of Points in Q1 and Q3) - (Number of points in Q2 and Q4)</span> <br>                                 (total number of points)</p><p>The QCR is always between -1 and +1, and can be converted to a percentage. If the QCR is &gt; 20% then it suggests a positive association, and &lt; -20% suggests a negative association.</p><p>More details on Quadrant Count Ratio and how it can be used in teaching can be found in Pip Arnold's book Statistical Investigations (page 325-326) or <a href="https://www.nctm.org/Standards-and-Positions/GAISE-II/">GAISE II</a> (pages 60-61).</p><h4>Show Ratio<br>Bootstrap Trendline<br>Jitter<br>Quadratic<br>Cubic<br>y=a*exp(b*x)<br>y=a*ln(x)+b<br>y=a*x^b<br>y=x<br>Stack Graphs<br>Gridlines<br>Invert Colours<br>Thick Lines<br>Show ID of Removed Points<br>Add Cust.
